# Demo of screen transitions with [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router) v4 on React Native

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
To try out the app, you can run it on [Expo](https://expo.io) using this link: https://exp.host/@traviskn/router-demo

If you want to play with the code and run/build the app yourself, clone this repository, install dependencies with npm,
then use `npm run ios` or `npm run android` to start the app on either an iOS or Android emulator.
