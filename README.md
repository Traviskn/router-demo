# Demo of screen transitions with [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) v4 on React Native

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).  To try out the app, clone this repository, install dependencies with npm, then use `npm run ios` or `npm run android` to start the app on either an iOS or Android emulator.
